3-1 Compiling Retroterm
------------------------

Retroterm is written for the ACME assembler, compiling the release version is
as simple as issuing:

    acme retroterm_univ.asm

The code uses some symbols to customize the executable, these are:

    _INTRO_: 1 = Compile with intro screen (Default 1)
    _HARDTYPE_: 56 = Compile for userport 57600bps (Default)
                232 = Compile for Turbo232 cartridge, 57600bps
                38 = Compile for Swiftlink cartridge, 38400bps
                     (PCM audio streaming at 7680Hz)
    _SPACE_: If defined the intro will wait for the a keypress
             (Default undefined)

The intro screen is a Screencode + colorRAM dump found in retro_logo.asm, this
file is generated by exporting to ACME format from Petmate (using
retrologo.petmate), with slight modifications, please check before overwriting
with your own version.
