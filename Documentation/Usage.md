**Retroterm** is very simple to use, most of its functionality <br>
being controlled externally from a **Turbo56K** enabled **BBS**.

**Retroterm** lacks classic file transfer functions, when used <br>
to communicate with a normal **PETSCII** **BBS**, file transfers <br>
are not available.

After **LOAD**ing and **RUN**ning **Retroterm**, you can dial to <br>
your favorite **BBS** using your Modem commands as usual.

To exit **Retroterm**, just press **RUN** / **STOP**, it will remain <br>
in memory and you can recall it with SYS49152.

If you downloaded a program to memory from a **BBS** you can also **RUN** it.

**Retroterm** beeps for every received character by default, <br>
you can toggle the sound by pressing <kbd>CBM + M</kbd>.
