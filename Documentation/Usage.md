Retroterm is very simple to use, most of its functionality being controlled
externally from a Turbo56K enabled BBS.
Retroterm lacks classic file transfer functions, when used to communicate with
a normal PETSCII BBS, file transfers are not available.

After LOADing and RUNning Retroterm, you can dial to your favourite BBS using
your Modem commands as usual.
To exit Retroterm, just press RUN/STOP, it will remain in memory and you can
recall it with SYS49152.
If you downloaded a program to memory from a BBS you can also RUN it.

Retroterm beeps for every received character by default, you can toggle the
sound by pressing CBM+M.
